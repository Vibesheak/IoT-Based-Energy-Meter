# IoT-Based-Energy-Meter
This project aimed to revolutionize the way we monitor and manage energy consumption. By integrating IoT technology, we've developed a smart energy meter that not only tracks real-time energy usage but also streamlines the billing process through automated SMS notifications.

Key features of the project include:
ðŸ”Œ Real-time Energy Monitoring: Users can now easily monitor their energy consumption in real-time via a user-friendly mobile app.
ðŸ’¬ Automated Billing System: Simplifying the billing process, our system automatically generates and sends billing information via SMS, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
ðŸ“± Mobile App Integration: Accessible from anywhere, users can conveniently view their energy usage and billing details on their mobile devices.
